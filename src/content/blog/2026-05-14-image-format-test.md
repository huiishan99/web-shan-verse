This is a draft page for testing the new Markdown-first image formatting.

The normal Markdown image still works. When the image title is empty, it uses the default size.

![Normal image](/images/header_galaxy.jpg)

Use `"wide"` when you want an image to feel more expansive inside the article.

![Wide image](/images/header_sabah.jpg "wide")

Use `"wide: caption text"` when you want a wide image with a caption.

![Wide image with caption](/images/pic-sandakan.jpg "wide: A wider image with a simple caption written directly in Markdown.")

Use `"small: caption text"` when the image should be more intimate and centered.

![Small image with caption](/images/bio-photo.jpg "small: A small centered image, useful for portraits or detail shots.")

You can also write only a title without a size. It becomes a normal image caption.

![Normal caption image](/images/pic-uoa.jpg "A normal image with a caption, no extra component syntax needed.")
